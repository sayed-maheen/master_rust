# learning rust

1. Rust started as a personal project in 2006, by Mozilla Research employee graydon Hoare. Mozilla began sponsoring the project in 2009 and first stable release was in 2015. So, as of 2023 Rust is 8 years old.
2. Rust is maintained as an Open Source project
3. Rust is a statically typed language. [Python is dynamically typed]
4. Rust is written in rust [all the standard compiler libraries of rust are written in rust].
5. Rust is designed to be an alternative to traditional systems programming languages such as C and C++, but with increased performance, improved memory safety and reliability.
6. Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language that emphasizes: performance [speed], safety [type safety, memory safety] and concurrency. 
7. It maintains memory safety without having a garbage collector, making it a useful language for a number of use cases like: embedding in other languages, programs with specific space and time requirements, and writing low-level code, like device drivers and operating systems. It performs compile-time safety checks that produce no runtime overhead, while eliminating all data races. [while, python has garbage collector]
8. Rust also aims to achieve ‘zero-cost abstractions’ even though some of these abstractions feel like those of a high-level language.  
9. Rust allows precise control like a low-level language
